First ever project by me and my friends.
========================================

This Repository contains the software that will be released on web 
(if implemented by us properly) to help us and our classmates share
useful links to each other.

We have just started in the world of programming so sorry for all the 
shortcomings and bad practices that may have crept into this work 
(We probably don't even know what is bad).

If you have any suggestions for us, they are more than welcome.
